## EE452 Computer Vision â€“ Assignment 1

### Training Neural Networks for Image Classification**

#### Overview

This assignment focuses on implementing various techniques for image classification using both traditional methods and deep learning. The tasks include:

* Performing image filtering using NumPy.
* Extracting HOG features and training a Linear SVM classifier.
* Building and training feedforward and convolutional neural networks from scratch using PyTorch.
* Applying regularization techniques to improve model performance.
* Using transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG-16 model.
* Conducting hyperparameter tuning and visualizing training results.

The assignment involves working with datasets such as Intel Image Classification, Fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 to evaluate different classification approaches.
